# cardio-911

This app is a prototype. The intended goal is that this app will be used for users with certain heart conditions
like Atrial Fibrillation, it will alert the users when the ranges of variation on their heart rate 
are beyond normal, it will also allow the user to notify one of his contacts and/or 911 about the situation.

Technologies used:
- Swift 2
- WatchOS 2

Will update this file while I implement all the expected features.
Getting ready for TADHack Chicago 2015.
